**Scatter Plot**

Scatter Plot is used to compare two numberic bussincess values on X & Y axis to find possible correlation between them.
It hlps to create trend line eqn and R sq.

Line eqn.
L = MX + C
M is slope, C is constant

two types of scatter plot
1. with aggregation
2. without aggregation
We dont use Integer values as they give straight line 

R sq is 0.25 i.e. 25% varitaiton in Y i sdue to varitation in X.
Remaining 75% can be due to unknown factors.
**VERY VERY BADD MODEL!!!!**
why? see equations below
				   
Actual Profit = 0.171755*Actual Revenue + 2.29105
R-Squared: 0.254641
P-value: < 0.0001
